Vert happy to announce the new release of Simple Weather Indicator, version 0.9. It was a big milestone for us and we are glad to succeed to deliver this version.
The new version (0.9) comes with many new features and weather metrics. You can find the list of the new features in below:

- Added weather condition overview
- Added humidity level 
- Added wind speed
- Added cloudiness level
- Added weather pressure
- Added weather visibility

In addition to that, we added package support for Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus). You can now easily install the indicator via PPA repository. For more information refer to installation page. 
On the other hand, in this release we have dropped the support for Ubuntu Wily (15.10), soon we will drop the support for Vivid as well. Our advice is to use the newer version which is still supported by Canonical.
