This project started as a spare time hubby/side project with limited time dedication and commitment. However, as the user base grown up, more time and energy spent to ensure users happiness and delivering of quality work. Additionally, to have a fully functional indicator, I decided to code and maintain own back end service, [Eris project](http://eris.madadipouya.com/) which is also freely available to public with no restrictions.

Beside code or document contributions, any amount of donation to help me to maintain and keep this project going is highly appreciated. You can always support me via Paypal.
